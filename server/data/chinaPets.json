If you and I are friends, I won’t hesitate to jump on you and show you my love. I enjoy playing with dogs too, but prefer smaller dogs over large ones. Come play with me at the SPCA Hong Kong Centre. Just walk in during our opening hours.",

It took the inspectors nearly 2 hours to rescue us all. I have been at the SPCA ever since, and all of my siblings have now been adopted. I am a bit of a sensitive boy and don’t enjoy being in kennels. What looks like aggression is actually kennel stress and fear and no dog should have to be in kennels this long. I enjoy playing ball games and will need an experienced and patient owner who can give me plenty of mental and physical stimulation. Please ask the staff at the Tsing Yi Centre about me - my trainers also have plenty of training tips and can give you a proper introduction.",

We often have adopters returning to adopt a second pet, or to find a new companion after their first has passed away.",

    "description": "Handsome, Charming, Cheerful It has been a nearly 4 years since Thor came to our adoption centre. He is a super neat furkid who prefers to potty outdoor just to not mess up his room. Thor is also very well-behaved! He rarely pulls on the leash when going out for walks and will follow wherever you go! For example, if you sit on the ground, he will sit with you. During his time at the centre, Thor has improved loads. He used to have problems getting along with other dogs but now he enjoys spending time with them! Please note that Thor may get a bit excited and bark at birds, cats and children. However, he certainly means no harm. Once you get to know him better, you will see that he is calm and has high-learning ability. A dog with such temperament is definitely suitable for first-time dog owners. Will you promise Thor a forever home and get to know the real him?",

My siblings have since gone on to find loving homes and only I remain. Although I can be a bit nervous to start, I am very affectionate as soon as I get to know you – rolling over for belly rubs and giving you plenty of kisses. Going out for walkies is my favourite and I am usually very confident walking on leash. All the girl dogs love to walk with me – maybe because I am a gentleman, as well as being tall, dark and handsome. I would love to find my forever home before my second birthday on 31 January – please come visit me and see if we make a good match!",

I am quite shy so was hiding in a bush, minding my own business, when a nice Inspector came to my rescue and took me back to the Centre for a check up. I am healthy and enjoy a quiet life – does that sound like you too?",

    "description": "Friendly, Charming, Timid Hi, my name is Mika! I was found with my siblings at Wai Tsai Tsuen, Yuen Long on 19 January 2023. Despite my size, I can be a bit scared of strangers and take a little time to warm up, but once I do I will affectionately lean on you for pets, and roll onto my back for belly rubs. I am great with other dogs and always very respectful when we play. Take me home for a lifetime of companionship!",

    "description": "Active, Gentle, Handsome, Introverted, Reserve, Talkative I was found with 2 other puppies in a drainage system in Aberdeen on 10 January 2023. My mum was nowhere to be found and I was very nervous. It takes me a bit of time to warm up to those I don’t know and I will always put on a big show when I am in my kennels to keep strangers at a distance but in reality I am actually quite scared. Once I trust you though, I will sit lovingly by your side and I enjoy nothing more than a run through the grass. Please give me a chance.",
