If you and I are friends, I won’t hesitate to jump on you and show you my love. I enjoy playing with dogs too, but prefer smaller dogs over large ones. Come play with me at the SPCA Hong Kong Centre. Just walk in during our opening hours.",

It took the inspectors nearly 2 hours to rescue us all. I have been at the SPCA ever since, and all of my siblings have now been adopted. I am a bit of a sensitive boy and don’t enjoy being in kennels. What looks like aggression is actually kennel stress and fear and no dog should have to be in kennels this long. I enjoy playing ball games and will need an experienced and patient owner who can give me plenty of mental and physical stimulation. Please ask the staff at the Tsing Yi Centre about me - my trainers also have plenty of training tips and can give you a proper introduction.",
